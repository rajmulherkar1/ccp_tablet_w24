              Bacon Q. Dog is a 9yr old labradoodle. He prefers to spend his days
              lounging among the three different beds/couches that his family has
              gifted him. He enjoys a walk or two around the neighborhood, as long
              as he can pretend that he doesn't see any of the other animals to
              avoid the embarrassment of not wanting to admit he has no wolf-like
              skills in chasing them.
            </p>
            <p>
              At night just as the rest of the family is ready to relax, Bacon
              suddenly wants to release all of his energy. He will place his toys on
              a mini couch and frantically drag the couch around, giving his toys "a
              ride." There is also a lot of rolling. Lots and lots of rolling.

              Pluto is a five year old rescue dog of an unknown breed. He was found
              wandering alone and taken to the Valley Humane Society where he found
              his new family. From a young age, Pluto always had a special
              personality, he was known for being very very lazy! He spends most of
              his time staring out the window to keep watch of his house. Don't let
              the laziness fool you because Pluto defends his family from the
              mailman and squirrels every single day.
            </p>
            <p>
              Aside from his job as defender of the house, Pluto likes to have fun.
              Pluto's favorite part of the day is his daily walk. Sometimes he even
              gets to go to the park and meet his neighbors. He also loves his toy
              duck, and only his toy duck. As a dog, it's in his nature to hunt and
              so he makes sure to get some practice with his toy duck.

              Sage is a 3 year old Golden Retriever. She is one of the laziest dogs.
              She loves sneaking into the bedroom and hopping onto the neatest bed.
              She also loves riding in a car with the windows open feeling the wind
              and air. She enjoys walking, only if you take her for a ride to a big
              arboretum or park. Walking around the neighborhood is not necessarily
              her cup of tea.
            </p>
            <p>
              Her favorite food is corn. One day, she stole corn on the cob from the
              dining table, which was surprising because she is normally gentle and
              polite. She took the stolen corn to the patio and enjoyed her meal by
              herself. Unfortunately, the corn turned out to be unripe, so she ended
              up vomiting it all later.
