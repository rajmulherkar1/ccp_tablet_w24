              Chicken Parmesan is a classic for a reason! Chicken cutlets, breaded
              and fried, smothered with tomato sauce, and covered with mozzarella
              and Parmesan cheeses are so good. Serve with pasta or on a roll.

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            4 chicken cutlets (about 1 1/2 pounds total), pounded to 1/4-inch
            thickness
          </li>
          <li>1/2 cup all-purpose flour</li>
          <li>2 large eggs, lightly beaten</li>
          <li>1 cup panko breadcrumbs</li>
          <li>1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
          <li>1/4 cup olive oil</li>
          <li>1/2 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
          <li>1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
          <li>1 1/2 cups marinara sauce</li>
          <li>4 ounces fresh mozzarella cheese, sliced</li>
          <li>1/4 cup chopped fresh basil leaves</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Directions</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Preheat the oven to 400°F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
          </li>
          <li>
            Place the flour, eggs, and panko in three separate shallow bowls.
            Add the Parmesan to the panko and stir to combine. Dip each chicken
            cutlet first in the flour, then the egg, and then the panko mixture,
            pressing the panko onto the chicken to help it adhere. Place the
            breaded chicken on the baking sheet.
          </li>
          <li>
            Heat the oil in a large frying pan over medium-high heat until
            shimmering. Add the chicken and cook until golden-brown, 2 to 3
            minutes per side. Transfer the chicken to a 9x13-inch baking dish
            and season with the salt and pepper. Pour the marinara sauce over
            the chicken and top with the mozzarella.
          </li>
          <li>
            Bake until the chicken is cooked through and the cheese is melted
            and bubbling, 15 to 20 minutes. Remove from the oven and let sit for
            5 minutes. Sprinkle with the basil and serve.
          </li>

              Chocolate cake is made with chocolate. It can also include other
              ingredients. These include fudge, vanilla creme, and other
              sweeteners.The history of chocolate cake goes back to 1764, when Dr.
              James Baker discovered how to make chocolate by grinding cocoa beans
              between two massive circular millstones.
            </p>
            <p>
              In 1828, Conrad Van Houten of the Netherlands developed a mechanical
              extraction method for extracting the fat from cacao liquor resulting
              in cacao butter and the partly defatted cacao, a compacted mass of
              solids that could be sold as it was "rock cacao" or ground into
              powder. The processes transformed chocolate from an exclusive luxury
              to an inexpensive daily snack. A process for making silkier and
              smoother chocolate called conching was developed in 1879 by Rodolphe
              Lindt and made it easier to bake with chocolate as it amalgamates
              smoothly and completely with cake batters.

              Chicken noodle soup is a soup made from chicken, simmered in water,
              usually with various other ingredients. The classic chicken soup
              consists of a clear chicken broth, often with pieces of chicken or
              vegetables; common additions are pasta, noodles, dumplings, or grains
              such as rice and barley.
            </p>
            <p>
              Chicken soup has acquired the reputation of a folk remedy for colds
              and influenza, and in many countries is considered a comfort food.
